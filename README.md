just a silly exercise in alternative facts.

Add arrays of fun to the `@altfacts` hash inside the AltFacter class (maybe that should be loaded from yaml or json or something...who knows).  Then run it and see what your system REALLY is made of. The number stuff *should* take care of itself.

Feel free to contribute or whatnot. I'll go back to being productive now.
